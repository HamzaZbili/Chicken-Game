# Fantastic Mr Chicken
Ironhack First Project

This game was my first coding project. I programmed it in four days after learning to code for two weeks. It was inspired by the box mechanic in Metal Gear Solid. Instead of Solid Snake, you play as a chicken and instead of a box, the chicken can dig to hide from the hungry fox. The aim of the game is to reach your nest without getting caught by the fox or running out of time.

The project was a great learning experience for me. It solidified a lot of concepts that I learned in the first two weeks at Ironhack. Had I had more time, I would love to have made this game responsive by adding HTML elements and controls for smaller screens.
